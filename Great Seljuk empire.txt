The Great Seljuk Empire or the Seljuk Empire was a high medieval Turko-Persian Sunni Muslim empire,originating from the Qiniq branch
of Oghuz Turks.At the time of its greatest extent, the Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area, stretching from western Anatolia and
the Levant in the west to the Hindu Kush in the east, and from Central Asia in the north to the Persian Gulf in the south.
The Seljuk empire was founded in 1037 by Tughril (990–1063) and his brother Chaghri (989–1060). From their homelands near the
Aral Sea, the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia, before eventually conquering Baghdad and
eastern Anatolia.The Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071, and then conquered most of the rest of Anatolia wresting it
from the Byzantine Empire.The Seljuk empire united the fractured political landscape of the eastern Islamic world and played
a key role in both the First Crusade and Second Crusade.The Seljuks also played an important part in the creation and
expansion of multiple art forms during the period in whichthey had influence.
